**Introduction to CSS: Lesson 3 - CSS Frameworks and Libraries**

Welcome to the third lesson in the CSS section of our course! In this lesson, we'll explore CSS frameworks and libraries, powerful tools that can save you time and effort when styling your web pages.

**What are CSS Frameworks and Libraries?**
CSS frameworks and libraries are pre-written collections of CSS styles, components, and layouts. They provide a foundation for styling your web pages, enabling you to create consistent and professional-looking designs quickly.

**Advantages of Using CSS Frameworks and Libraries**
- **Rapid Development:** Frameworks offer predefined styles and components, speeding up the development process.
- **Consistency:** They ensure a cohesive design throughout your project.
- **Responsive Design:** Many frameworks are built with responsive design principles in mind.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Frameworks are tested across various browsers for consistent results.
- **Customization:** You can adapt and customize the framework to match your project's unique needs.

**Popular CSS Frameworks and Libraries**
Here are a few well-known frameworks and libraries you might consider using:
- **Bootstrap:** A widely used framework that offers responsive grids, UI components, and JavaScript plugins.
- **Foundation:** Known for its responsive features and customization options.
- **Bulma:** Based on Flexbox, Bulma provides a modern and flexible approach to styling.
- **Semantic UI:** Focuses on human-friendly HTML and provides a range of components.
- **Materialize:** Implements Google's Material Design, offering a clean and intuitive design language.

**Using Bootstrap as an Example**
Let's take a quick look at how to use Bootstrap:
1. Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML.
2. Utilize Bootstrap classes to style elements and create responsive layouts.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Using Bootstrap</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a styled paragraph.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
    </div>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Your Task: Styling with Bootstrap**
For this lesson's assignment, choose one of the CSS frameworks mentioned earlier (e.g., Bootstrap) and create a new HTML page. Implement the framework's components and styling to enhance the appearance of your web page. Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to match your preferences.
