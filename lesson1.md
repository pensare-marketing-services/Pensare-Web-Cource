# Lesson 1: What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a **markup language** used to create **web pages**. HTML defines the structure of a web page, such as the **headings**, **paragraphs**, **images**, and **lists**.

## Why learn HTML?

HTML is the **foundation of web development**. If you want to create **web pages**, you need to learn HTML. HTML is also a **relatively easy language to learn**, so it's a good place to start if you're new to programming.

## How to learn HTML?

There are many ways to learn HTML. You can:

* Take an online course
* Read a book
* Watch tutorials on YouTube
* Use free resources, such as the [W3Schools HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

## The basics of HTML

An HTML document is made up of **elements**. An element is a piece of markup that tells the browser how to display the content. Elements are enclosed in **tags**. The **opening tag** tells the browser what kind of element it is, and the **closing tag** tells the browser where the element ends.

For example, the following code defines a heading element:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```


The `<h1>` tag tells the browser that this is a heading, and the `</h1>` tag tells the browser where the heading ends.

Here are some of the most common HTML elements:

* `h1`: Heading
* `p`: Paragraph
* `img`: Image
* `ul`: Unordered list
* `ol`: Ordered list
* `a`: Link

## Creating your first HTML document

To create your first HTML document, you need to create a text file and save it with the `.html` extension. For example, you could create a file called `index.html`.

Once you have created the file, you can start adding HTML code. The following code is a simple example of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My First HTML Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is my first HTML document</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
