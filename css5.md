**Introduction to CSS: Lesson 5 - Responsive Web Design with CSS Media Queries**

Welcome to the fifth lesson in the CSS section of our course! In this lesson, we'll explore the concept of responsive web design and how CSS media queries enable you to create web pages that adapt beautifully to various devices and screen sizes.

**Understanding Responsive Web Design**
Responsive web design is an approach that ensures your web pages look and function well on different devices, from large desktop monitors to small smartphone screens. With the increasing variety of devices used to access the internet, responsive design is essential to provide a seamless user experience.

**CSS Media Queries**
Media queries are a powerful feature of CSS that allow you to apply different styles based on various conditions, such as screen width, height, and orientation. This enables you to create layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

```css
/* Apply styles for screens up to 768px wide */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
}
```

**Viewport Meta Tag**
The `viewport` meta tag is used in the `<head>` section of your HTML to control the layout on mobile browsers. It ensures that your web page scales and adjusts its content to fit different screen sizes.

```html
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
```

**Creating a Responsive Layout**
To create a responsive layout, you can use CSS techniques such as fluid grids, flexible images, and relative units. Flexbox and CSS Grid are also valuable tools for building responsive designs.

**Testing Responsive Designs**
It's important to test your responsive designs on various devices and screen sizes to ensure they work as intended. You can use browser developer tools to simulate different devices and resolutions.

**Your Task: Create a Responsive Page**
For this lesson's assignment, take a web page you created earlier and enhance it with responsive design. Apply CSS media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and spacing to create a seamless experience across different devices.

**Conclusion**
