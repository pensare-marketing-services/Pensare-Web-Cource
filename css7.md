**Introduction to CSS: Lesson 7 - CSS Animation Libraries**

Welcome to the seventh lesson in the CSS section of our course! In this lesson, we'll dive into CSS animation libraries, which provide pre-built animations and effects that you can easily integrate into your web projects.

**What are CSS Animation Libraries?**
CSS animation libraries are collections of pre-designed animations and transitions that you can use in your web projects. These libraries often provide a range of effects, from subtle transitions to complex animations.

**Benefits of Using CSS Animation Libraries**
- **Time-Saving:** Animation libraries provide ready-to-use effects, saving you the time and effort of coding animations from scratch.
- **Consistency:** Libraries offer consistent and well-designed animations that enhance your website's visual appeal.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Libraries are often tested across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
- **Customizability:** While libraries offer predefined animations, you can often customize them to match your project's design.

**Popular CSS Animation Libraries**
Here are a few widely used CSS animation libraries:
- **Animate.css:** Provides a wide range of simple and complex animations that you can apply with just CSS classes.
- **Hover.css:** Focuses on animated hover effects, making elements come to life when users interact with them.
- **Magic Animations:** Offers a set of fun and magical animations that can add whimsy to your website.
- **Motion UI:** Part of the Foundation framework, it provides customizable and flexible animation options.
- **GreenSock (GSAP):** A highly robust and powerful animation library that supports both CSS and JavaScript animations.

**Using Animate.css as an Example**
To use Animate.css, follow these steps:
1. Include the Animate.css stylesheet in your HTML.
2. Add the desired animation classes to your elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Using Animate.css</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="animated bounce">Bouncing Element</div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Your Task: Implement an Animation**
For this lesson's assignment, choose one of the CSS animation libraries mentioned earlier and create a new web page. Integrate an animation from the library into your page. You can apply the animation to a button, image, or any other element you choose.
