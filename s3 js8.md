**Introduction to JavaScript: Lesson 8 - Scope and Closures**

Welcome to the eighth lesson in the JavaScript section of our course! In this lesson, we'll delve into the concept of scope and closures, which play a crucial role in how variables are accessed and managed in your code.

**Understanding Scope**
Scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables within different parts of your code. Variables can have different scopes, such as global scope and local scope.

**Global Scope**
Variables declared outside of any function have global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in your code.

```javascript
let globalVariable = "I'm global!";

function printGlobal() {
    console.log(globalVariable);
}

printGlobal(); // Output: I'm global!
```

**Local Scope**
Variables declared inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed within that function.

```javascript
function printLocal() {
    let localVariable = "I'm local!";
    console.log(localVariable);
}

printLocal(); // Output: I'm local!
console.log(localVariable); // Error: localVariable is not defined
```

**Block Scope**
In modern JavaScript, variables declared with `let` and `const` have block scope, meaning they're limited to the block in which they're defined (e.g., within loops or conditional statements).

```javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVariable = "I'm in a block!";
    console.log(blockVariable);
}

console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
```

**Closures**
Closures occur when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even when executed outside of that scope. This allows functions to access variables from their parent scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I'm outer!";
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

let closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Output: I'm outer!
```

**Your Task: Closure Practice**
For this lesson's assignment, create a JavaScript program that demonstrates closures. Define an outer function that contains a variable. Inside the outer function, define an inner function that accesses the outer variable. Return the inner function and execute it to see the closure in action.

**Conclusion**
Congratulations! You've completed the eighth lesson in the JavaScript section. You've gained a deeper understanding of scope and closures, which are crucial concepts for managing variable visibility and creating efficient and modular code. In the next lesson, we'll explore asynchronous programming and how JavaScript handles tasks that don't occur immediately. Keep up the great work on your web development journey!
