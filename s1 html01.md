**Introduction to Web Development: Lesson 1 - Understanding Comments in JavaScript**

Welcome to the world of web development! In this course, we will take you on a journey to master the art of creating websites and web applications. Our first lesson is all about understanding comments in JavaScript. Comments might seem like a small aspect of coding, but they play a vital role in making your code more readable and understandable.

**What are Comments and Why Use Them?**
Comments are lines of text in your code that JavaScript will completely ignore when executing. They are meant for human readers, including yourself and others who might work with your code. Think of comments as notes you leave behind to explain what your code is doing and why it's doing it.

**Types of Comments in JavaScript**
There are two primary ways to add comments in JavaScript:

1. **Single-line Comments using `//`**
   Use `//` to create single-line comments. JavaScript will ignore everything after `//` on the same line. Single-line comments are useful for adding short explanations or notes.

   ```javascript
   // This is a single-line comment.
   ```

2. **Multi-line Comments using `/* */`**
   When you need to add more detailed comments that span multiple lines, you can use `/*` to start a comment block and `*/` to end it. Everything between these markers will be ignored by JavaScript.

   ```javascript
   /* This is a
      multi-line comment */
   ```

**The Importance of Commenting Your Code**
Commenting your code is a best practice in programming. It serves several purposes:

- **Enhances Readability:** Well-placed comments provide context, making it easier for you and others to understand the code's purpose.
- **Collaboration:** If you're working with a team, comments ensure that everyone is on the same page.
- **Future Reference:** You might revisit your code months later; comments help you remember your thought process.
- **Debugging:** Comments can help you identify the cause of issues when troubleshooting.

**Your Task: Adding Comments**
Let's put your knowledge into practice. Open your preferred code editor and create a new JavaScript file (you can name it `comments.js`). Write both types of comments to illustrate your understanding.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment.

/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

**Conclusion**
Congratulations! You've completed the first lesson of our web development course. You now understand the significance of comments in JavaScript and how they contribute to writing clean and understandable code. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into variables and data types in JavaScript. Keep up the great work!
